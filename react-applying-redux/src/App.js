            <p className='ans'>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h2>2. What is Redux Thunk used for?</h2>
            <p className='ans'>
              Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises.
              <br />
              <br />
              One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request. Redux Thunk allows us to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.

            <h2>3. What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?</h2>
            <p className='ans'>
              React pure components are the components that do not re-render when the value of props and state has been updated with the same values. Since these components do not cause re-rendering when the same values are passed thus they improve performance.
              <br />
              <br />
              A component should be made pure if its render causes a performance issue and the render can be prevented by making the component pure.

            <h2>4. What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?</h2>
            <p className='ans'>
              The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get re-rendered.
              <br />
              <br />
              The purpose of the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a to make updates after the state is changed. This function will get called once the state has been updated, and the callback will receive the updated value of the state.
