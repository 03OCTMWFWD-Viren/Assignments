    <h1>List and Hooks</h1>
    <p>
        Functional and class components in react differ in syntax and lifecycle management.
        <br />
        Functional component use a function with a return statement to render, class component use 'render()'.
        <br />
        Function components use hooks, class components use React lifecycle methods.
        <br />
        A React component undergoes three different phases in its lifecycle, including mounting, updating, and
        unmounting.
        <br />
        <!-- <blockquote> -->
        React 16.8 release in 2019 changed everything.
        <br />
        It introduced React hooks.
        <br />
        React hooks are functions that let functional components manage state, handle lifecycle events, and access other
        React features.
        <br />
        Before hooks, you could only do that using class components.
        <!-- </blockquote> -->
        Functional component - Uses react hooks to handle lifecycle events like useState, useEffect, useMemo.
        <br />
        Class component - Uses class lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and
        componentWillUnmount.
