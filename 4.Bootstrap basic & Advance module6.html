            <h2>2.What is Bootstrap Container, and how does it work ?</h2>
            <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.</p>
            <p> Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.</p>
            <p>While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
            <p>.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</p>

            <h2>4.What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System ?</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.</p>
            <p>It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive.</p>
            <p>Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site's contents. Use .container for a responsive pixel width or .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.</p>
            <p>Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them.</p>
            <p>This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.</p>
            <p>In a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.</p>
